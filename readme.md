This repository contains OCCI extensions related to Roboconf.  
Some aims at being used at runtime. Others were built for code generation only.

They were built with the [OCCIware studio](http://occiware.github.io).  
See also http://roboconf.net/en/developer-guide/occi-model.html for more details.

* Roboconf graph: an extension to generate graph(s) files.
* Roboconf instances: an extension to generate instances files (and that depends on the graph extension).
